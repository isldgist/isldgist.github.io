          <p class="research-mission-text">At ISL Lab, our mission is to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and the physical world. Moving beyond traditional model scaling paradigms, we strive to advance a new generation of practical and deployable Physical AI capable of operating reliably in complex, real-world environments.</p>
          <p class="research-mission-text" style="margin-top: 0.85rem;">To this end, our research focuses on Knowledge Integration, enabling the adaptation of large foundation models to domain-specific physical tasks. We explore World Models and test-time self-evolving architectures to ensure adaptive and resilient behavior under real-world uncertainty, and ultimately pursue efficient on-device AI that delivers reliable intelligence on resource-constrained systems.</p>
